River Architect
===============

The analysis, research and science-based design of fluvial ecosystems involve complex challenges for interdisciplinary experienced teams. We have created *flusstools* to meet the complex challenges and to at least partially automate time-consuming, repetitive processes. "We" stands for individuals with a great passion for rivers (German: "Fl√ºsse") and programming. Most of us work (or have worked) at the University of Stuttgart (Germany) at the `Institute for Modelling Hydraulic and Environmental Systems`_. In the context of our scientific endeavor, we have a strong commitment to transparent open-source applications. With *flusstools*, we want to share our research-based open-source algorithms with a broad interest group in a well documented form. We welcome new team members (for example to add or amend a module) at any time - read more in the :ref:`contribute` section.

Currently, *flusstools* comes with the following modules:

* *geotools* - versatile functions for processing spatial data for fluvial ecosystem analyses based on `gdal`_ and other open source libraries (developers: `Kilian Mouris`_, `Beatriz Negreiros`_, and `Sebastian Schwindt`_).
* *fuzzycorr* - a map comparison toolkit that builds on fuzzy sets to assess the accuracy of (numerical) river models (principal developer: `Beatriz Negreiros`_).
* *lidartools* - *Python* wrappers for `lastools`_ (forked and modified from `Kenny Larrieu`_).

    The documentation is also as available as `style-adapted PDF <https://flusstools.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/>`_.
